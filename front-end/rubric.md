# Front End Engineering Challenge - Rubric

GA is designing a new site aimed at K-12 learners to access some GA courses and content. Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive navbar for this site with login/logout.


**Communicate with potential employers using appropriate technical terms.**   

  - Makes a *responsive* site (looks different - and good! - on different screen sizes). 
  
  - Implements something that is identifiably a *navbar*. 
  
  - Includes at least one *breakpoint* where the layout changes.




**Demonstrate knowledge of software construction patterns and best practices.**


  - Adds comments to the code that help navigate and explain any less clear portions.   

  - Encapsulates login/logout bonus button feature in a function so that if a backend is added the changes required are limited to one area.

  - Uses consistent code style for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documents.
  
  - If using a fuller front-end framework like Angular, follows conventions of that framework.


  - Includes a CSS file, linked properly in the head of the html document. 



**Consider design and implementation alternatives and make decisions based on relevant characteristics of the problem and available tools.**


  - Consciously choose to use a front-end framework or library (or not) and document reasons for making that choice.   

  - If using a framework:  

    - follow conventions of that framework (very important: proper use of grid system).  
    
    - use the correct components from that framework (e.g.: Bootstrap's navbar, perhaps navbar-collapse).  

  - If not using a framework, use media queries to create responsive effect, and justify choice of breakpoint.   

  - Bonus: create a page that looks reasonable without JavaScript loaded ("progressive enhancement").




**Demonstrate awareness of real-world technical development practices and concerns related to the target company, including testing and security.**  

  - Describes basic user stories: what should users be able to do with this navbar?  

  - If using a framework like Bootstrap, adds custom CSS to distinguish this site from others using the framework.   

  - References existing GA site design and documents reasons for differing from the look and feel of existing GA sites.  

  - Mentions the fact that some of the site's users will be children, and/or discusses design elements to reflect this.
