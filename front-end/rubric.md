# Front End Engineering Challenge - Rubric

GA is designing a new site aimed at K-12 learners to access some GA courses and content. Use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to develop a responsive navbar for this site with login/logout.


**Communicate with potential employers using appropriate technical terms.**   

The candidate should:

  - have a *responsive* site (it should look different - and good! - on different screen sizes).

  - use a separate CSS file, linked properly in the head of the html document. 

  - understand "navbar" and implement something that is identifiably a navbar. 



**Demonstrate knowledge of software construction patterns and best practices.**

An ideal candidate should:

  - add comments to the code that help navigate and explain any less clear portions.   

  - encapsulate login/logout bonus button feature in a function.   

  - use consistent code style for html, css, and javascript documents.


  

**Consider design and implementation alternatives and make decisions based on relevant characteristics of the problem and available tools.**


An ideal candidate should:

  - consciously choose to use a front-end framework or library (or not) and give reasons for making that choice.   

  - if using a framework, follow conventions of that framework (very important: proper use of grid system).   

  - if using a framework, use the correct components from that framework (e.g.: Bootstrap's navbar-responsive).  

  - if not using a framework, use media queries to create responsive effect, and justify choice of breakpoint.   

  - create a page that looks reasoanble without JavaScript loaded (bonus - "progressive enhancement").




**Demonstrate awareness of real-world technical development practices and concerns related to the target company, including testing and security.**  

An ideal candidate:

 - references existing GA site design and documents reasons for differing from the look and feel of existing GA sites.  

 - describes basic user stories: what should users be able to do with this navbar?  

 - acknowledges the fact that some of the site's users will be children, and adds design elements to reflect this.  

  - if using a framework, adds custom CSS to distinguish this site from others using the framework.
